Changelog
=========

0.3.1 (2012-01-18)
------------------

* Fixed a bug in the template rendering, where the namespace was not passed
  as a keyword argument. This has been fixed.


0.3 (2012-01-17)
----------------

* Echoed the last changes in ``cromlech.browser``. `ILayout` is no longer a 
  `IHTTPRenderer` but a `IRenderer` this means : it's no longer callable,
  it no longer needs to return a response object and it doesn't hold any
  `responseFactory`.

* ``cromlech.browser`` no longer defines `context` and `request` attrs for
  the `IView` component and some other. This means, we can no longer assume
  that the rendered view holds these attributes, therefore the `layout`
  decorator has been removed. It needs to be implemented in ``dolmen.view``,
  for this very specific implementation.

* The namespace is no longer updated using `update`, but is injected
  on-the-fly in the template, in the `render` method (if a template is used).
  This means that the namespace is no longer updatable out-of-the-box.


0.2a2 (2012-01-11)
------------------

* I18n doesn't raise an error if no languages preference has been registered.

* Adapted the code for the newest `cromlech` packages.


0.2a1 (2011-11-24)
------------------

* Added i18n handling to render the template. It uses ``cromlech.i18n``.


0.1a1 (2011-05-10)
------------------

* Initial release
